# Optimizing Cell-Based Software Architecture through Heuristic Community Detection Approach

This repository contains data for the research paper titled *"Optimizing Cell-Based Software Architecture through Heuristic Community Detection Approach"* by Miloš Milić, Nebojša Nikolić, and Dragana Makajić-Nikolić. The repository includes the following artefacts:

- [`code`](code) – Contains the source code of the developed software system related to a manufacturing domain. [Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com) must be installed to build and run the container.
- [`simulation_test_plan`](simulation_test_plan) – Includes the file `community_detection_test_plan.jmx` and accompanying CSV files with mock data. [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org) must be installed to execute the simulation test plan.
- [`simulation_results`](simulation_results) – Contains the file `results.csv` with simulation results.
- [`input_data`](input_data) – Provides various input data used for optimization.
- [`mathematical_model`](mathematical_model) – Contains the `GLPK` `.mod` file for the developed mathematical model. [GLPK – GNU Linear Programming Kit](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk) must be installed to run the model.
- [`optimization_results`](optimization_results) – Includes the results of the optimization process.
- [`heuristic`](heuristic) – Contains the source code for the developed heuristic. [Python](https://www.python.org) must be installed to run the heuristic.
